   - **Email**: `seza.studio.website@gmail.com`
   - **Password**: `Cartones2016` (use App Password, not regular password)
   - **Service Name**: `seza_automation`

#### **Step 4: Get Public Key**
1. Go to "Account" → "General"
2. Copy your **Public Key** (e.g., `user_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

#### **Step 5: Update Environment Variables**

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add these variables:

```
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_seza_automation
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_seza_contact
```

**In Local Development:**
Create `.env` file in your project root:
```env
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_seza_automation
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_seza_contact
```

#### **Step 6: Update Email Service Configuration**

The `workingEmailService.ts` is already configured to use these environment variables. Once you set them up, emails will be sent automatically.

### **🔧 Gmail App Password Setup (Important!)**

Since you're using `seza.studio.website@gmail.com` with password `Cartones2016`, you need to:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on the Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate new app password for "Mail"
   - Use this app password (not the regular password) in EmailJS

### **📊 Current Status:**
